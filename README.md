Riemann-Sum-Approximator
========================

Applet for graphing functions and approximating areas under the curve with different amounts of shapes.

The user may choose parameters for a few graphs (ax + b, ax^2 + b, etc) or may draw a custom function with the mouse over the coordinate axes.
The user may then choose a shape to approximate the area under the curve of the graph with a certain shape and an approximation method. At first, there is only one shape approximating the area, but as the user clicks the approximating shapes more, the shapes split and a better (hopefully) approximation is shown. 

The best results are seen when the upper and lower bounds of the approximation are multiples of .1.
